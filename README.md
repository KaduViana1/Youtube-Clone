A clone  of the YouTube's desktop version built with Typescript React.js using styled components and react-router-dom.

It simulates the homepage, with the expansive side-bar, dropdown for settings where you choose between light and dark themes and your preference gets saved
on the localstorage, videos and shorts sections that changes the displays when the side-bar is open or closed, the category-bar that scrolls horizontally
when you click the button. It also have pages for login and user creation, when logged in, the application uses a jsonwebtoken to keep the authentication
for 30 days.

The app uses my API(https://github.com/KaduViana1/PP-api-YT) to make connection to a MySQl database for user creation, user authentication
and video templates for the search page.
